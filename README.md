# Location-Based-Traffic-Governor

Over-speeding is one the major cause of accidents. Speed governor is a device whose primary function is to control the speed of the engine in order to limit the vehicle speed.
However such devices could be set to only a single speed limit and speed limit of each place varies. Thus it's impossible for the government to mandate the use of such a device

The proposed system is location based speed governor. The system uses the GPS location to identify the speed limit of the particular location and the speed limit is set accordingly. The speed governor is a simple which could be installed to any vehicle. The speed breaker is directly connected to a central gps system and the engine
The device gets the real time location of the vehicle using GPS. As the device is connected directly connected to the engine is can maintain the speed in the prescribed limit
If the vehicles a zone with higher/lower limit the device will automatically change the speed barrier
The circuit is

**FOR RUNNING**


The simulation is done on proteus, the cracked version could be installed using https://we.tl/t-GRDTn5wjxk
To run the simulation install proteus using the link and run FINAL_DESIGN.pdsprj on proteus and load the hex code to the pic controller

and you can change the switches inorder to simulate different speedsCancel changes
